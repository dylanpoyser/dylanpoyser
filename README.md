### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

My name is Dylan Poyser and I'm an actor/musician turned full stack software engineer!  

ğŸ”­ I'm currently working on a few music-related app ideas, including one to aid in songwriting.

ğŸ˜„ My pronouns are He/His!

âš¡ Fun fact: I have a deep and abiding love for languages and cultures, and my goal is to learn basic greetings in every language I can!
